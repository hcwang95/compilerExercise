   Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman,
television personality, politician, and the 45th President
of the United States.  Born and raised in Queens, New York City,
Trump received an economics degree from the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania in 1968.  In 1971, he took charge of his
family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son,
which was later renamed The Trump Organization.  During his business
career, Trump has built, renovated, and managed numerous office
towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses.
   Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000,
but withdrew before voting began.  He considered running as a Republican
for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it.
In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election,
and quickly emerged as the front-runner among 17 contenders in the
Republican primaries.  His final opponents suspended their campaigns
in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the
Republican Convention along with Mike Pence as his running mate.
His campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international
attention.  Many of his statements in interviews, on social
media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false.
